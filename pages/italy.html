          Italy (Italian: Italia [iˈtaːlja] (listen)), officially the Italian
          Republic[a][11][12] or the Republic of Italy,[13][14] is a country in
          Southern[15][16][17] and Western[18][note 1] Europe. Located in the
          middle of the Mediterranean Sea, it consists of a peninsula delimited
          by the Alps and surrounded by several islands; its territory largely
          coincides with the homonymous geographical region.[19] Italy shares
          land borders with France, Switzerland, Austria, Slovenia and the
          enclaved microstates of Vatican City and San Marino. It has a
          territorial exclave in Switzerland, Campione, and some islands in the
          African Plate. Italy covers an area of 301,230 km2 (116,310 sq mi),
          with a population of about 60 million.[20] It is the third-most
          populous member state of the European Union, the sixth-most populous
          country in Europe, and the tenth-largest country in the continent by
          land area. Italy's capital and largest city is Rome. Italy was the
          native place of civilizations such as the Italic peoples and the
          Etruscans, while due to its central geographic location in Southern
          Europe and the Mediterranean, the country has also historically been
          home to myriad peoples and cultures, who immigrated to the peninsula
          throughout history.[21][22] The Latins, native of central Italy,
          formed the Roman Kingdom in the 8th century BC, which eventually
          became a republic with a government of the Senate and the People. The
          Roman Republic initially conquered and assimilated its neighbours on
          the Italian peninsula, eventually expanding and conquering a large
          part of Europe, North Africa and Western Asia. By the first century
          BC, the Roman Empire emerged as the dominant power in the
          Mediterranean Basin and became a leading cultural, political and
          religious centre, inaugurating the Pax Romana, a period of more than
          200 years during which Italy's law, technology, economy, art, and
          literature developed.[23][24]

          During the Early Middle Ages, Italy endured the fall of the Western
          Roman Empire and the Barbarian Invasions, but by the 11th century,
          numerous city-states and maritime republics, mostly in the North,
          became prosperous through trade, commerce, and banking, laying the
          groundwork for modern capitalism.[25][26] The Renaissance began in
          Italy and spread to the rest of Europe, bringing a renewed interest in
          humanism, science, exploration, and art. During the Middle Ages,
          Italian explorers discovered new routes to the Far East and the New
          World, helping to usher in the European Age of Discovery. However,
          centuries of rivalry and infighting between the Italian city-states,
          and the invasions of other European powers during the Italian Wars of
          the 15th and 16th centuries, left Italy politically
          fragmented.[27][28] Italy's commercial and political power
          significantly waned during the 17th and 18th centuries with the
          decline of the Catholic Church and the increasing importance of trade
          routes that bypassed the Mediterranean.[29] By the mid-19th century,
          rising Italian nationalism, along with other social, economic, and
          military events, led to a period of revolutionary political
          upheaval.[30] After centuries of political and territorial divisions,
          Italy was almost entirely unified in 1861 following a war of
          independence, establishing the Kingdom of Italy.[31] From the late
          19th century to the early 20th century, Italy rapidly industrialised,
          mainly in the north, and acquired a colonial empire,[32] while the
          south remained largely impoverished and excluded from
          industrialisation, fuelling a large and influential diaspora.[33]
