          Moldova (/mɒlˈdoʊvə/ (listen) mol-DOH-və, sometimes UK: /ˈmɒldəvə/
          MOL-də-və;[13][14][15] Romanian pronunciation: [molˈdova]), officially
          the Republic of Moldova (Romanian: Republica Moldova), is a landlocked
          country in Eastern Europe.[16] It is bordered by Romania to the west
          and Ukraine to the north, east, and south.[17] The unrecognised state
          of Transnistria lies across the Dniester river on the country's
          eastern border with Ukraine. Moldova's capital and largest city is
          Chișinău. Most of Moldovan territory was a part of the Principality of
          Moldavia from the 14th century until 1812, when it was ceded to the
          Russian Empire by the Ottoman Empire (to which Moldavia was a vassal
          state) and became known as Bessarabia. In 1856, southern Bessarabia
          was returned to Moldavia, which three years later united with
          Wallachia to form Romania, but Russian rule was restored over the
          whole of the region in 1878. During the 1917 Russian Revolution,
          Bessarabia briefly became an autonomous state within the Russian
          Republic. In February 1918, it declared independence and then
          integrated into Romania later that year following a vote of its
          assembly. The decision was disputed by Soviet Russia, which in 1924
          established, within the Ukrainian SSR, a so-called Moldavian
          autonomous republic on partially Moldovan-inhabited territories to the
          east of Bessarabia.

          In 1940, as a consequence of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact, Romania was
          compelled to cede Bessarabia and Northern Bukovina to the Soviet
          Union, leading to the creation of the Moldavian Soviet Socialist
          Republic (Moldavian SSR). On 27 August 1991, as the dissolution of the
          Soviet Union was underway, the Moldavian SSR declared independence and
          took the name Moldova.[18] However, the strip of Moldovan territory on
          the east bank of the Dniester has been under the de facto control of
          the breakaway government of Transnistria since 1990. The constitution
          of Moldova was adopted in 1994, and the country became a parliamentary
          republic with a president as head of state and a prime minister as
          head of government. Moldova is the second poorest country in Europe by
          GDP per official capita after Ukraine and much of its GDP is dominated
          by the service sector.[19] It has one of the lowest Human Development
          Indexes in Europe, ranking 76th in the world (2022).[12] Moldova is a
          member state of the United Nations, the Council of Europe, the World
          Trade Organization, the Organization for Security and Cooperation in
          Europe, the GUAM Organization for Democracy and Economic Development,
          the Commonwealth of Independent States, the Organization of the Black
          Sea Economic Cooperation, and the Association Trio. Moldova has been
          an official candidate for membership in the European Union since June
          2022.[20]
